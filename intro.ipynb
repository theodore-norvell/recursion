    "Recursion is a very useful technique in many applications and forms the basis of efficient solutions using techniques such as memoization and dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also elegant and beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes are a sequence of exercises to help you to get used to thinking up recursive solutions to algorithmic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about exercises is that watching someone else do them doesn't help you much.  So I encourage you to actually try to fill in all the missing parts before looking at my solutions."

    "## The design process\n",
    "\n",
    "Each page in these notes illustrates the same design process for arriving at a solution.  Most of the steps of this process aren't just good for applying recursion, but really for any programming problem that you come across.  In day to day practice you may, do some of the steps in your head without writing anything down, however it's rarely a good idea not to skip any steps, even if you just do them in your head.  The process is this\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Problem\n",
    "  * Write down clearly what the problem to be solved is.\n",
    "  * If need be, generalize the problem.\n",
    "  * Write a program contract.\n",
    "* Analyse the problem\n",
    "  * Recursive cases: Understand how solutions to smaller instances can be used to build solutions to larger instances.\n",
    "  * Base cases: Make sure that instances too small to be broken down further are understood.\n",
    "  * Check that there is no circularity by identifying the variant.\n",
    "  * Write some test cases.\n",
    "* The solution\n",
    "  * Write your algorithm in pseudo-code.\n",
    "  * Analyse the algorithm to ensure it follows your analysis of the problem.\n",

    "## Using Python and/or Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "I did all my coding in Python 3.5.  You are welcome to use any language you want.  It may be easiest to use Python, since my examples are in Python and my contracts are written in terms of Python's data types, but you can adapt the examples to any high-level language that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons I choose to use Python are several:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a widely used language.\n",
    "* It has direct support for sets and sequences.\n",
    "* It works well with Jupyter Notbook -- I'll explain what that is later.\n",
    "* I wanted to learn to use Python better.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice surprise about Python was that it supports large integers natively. A less pleasant surprise was that, by default, Python limits recursion depth to a low number (1000 in my implementation); there are ways to increase this limit, but you risk crashing the interpreter if you increase it too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know Python, but want to use it anyway, it's really important to explicitly write out your pseudocode. That way you can think about the algoirthm without having to worry about the language, and then, later, figure our how to translate your algorithm into Python without having to worry about the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a web application that lets you easily write web pages that contain code and also to execute that code and put the results into the web page.  I'll say more about Jupyter Notebook on the next page."
