    "\n",
    "In general she'd like to know how many ways she can pick $r$ things out of a set of $n$ things.  Of course this only makes sense if $0 \\le r \\le n$.  Let's call this function `combinations` so `combinations(n, r)` will be the number of ways to pick a subset of size `r` out of a set of size `n`.\n",

    "Alice thinks about her 10 friends.  Every subset will either contain her friend Bill the Lizard or it won't. First she thinks about how many sets of size 5 include Bill.  There will be one such set for each way she could make a set of size 4 of out of the 9 remaining friends.  That's $combinations( 9, 4 )$. What about the sets that don't include Bill.  The number of those will be the number of sets of size 5 she can make out of her remaining 9 friends.  That's #combinationd( 9, 5 )$ Since each set either contains Bill or doesn't, we've accounted for all sets of size 5 that can by made from her 10 friends. And we haven't counted any twice.  We have \n",

    ">    $combinations(n, 0) = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$\n",

    "\n",
    ">    $combinations(n, n) = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "So altogether we have three properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $combinations(n, 0) = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n",
    "2. $combinations(n, n) = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n",
